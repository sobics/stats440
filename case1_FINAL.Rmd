The purpose of the assay is to screen chemicals for estrogenic effects ïƒ  agonist (EE) or antagonist (ZM). One clear challenge is the consistency among variables and protocols throughout all data in the study. It is necessary to identify any possible differences between labs and protocols in order to discover the consistency and effectiveness of the two chemicals.
